        <p>A marker that designates a function as unsafe, or containing Undefined Behaviour if its preconditions are not met.</p><p>Use of an unsafe function should require a comment documenting how the required preconditions are met in the form:</p><p></p><pre><code>// SAFETY: This is known to be true because of that which we checked there.
do_risky_thing(unsafe_fn);
</code></pre><p></p><p>Input conditions of the unsafe function should be well encapsulated so that it is even possible to reason about how they are met and to maintain that over time.</p><p>To call such an unsafe function, pass it the global <code>unsafe_fn</code> object, which is brought into the global namespace by "subspace/prelude.h".</p>
